Lunar Lander
-----------

A spaceship simulation: your job is to land the Apollo lunar capsule on the moon.

This is a port of the original lunar lander written in FOCAL. Original source code: http://www.vintage-basic.net/bcg/lunar.bas.  It is ported as close as possible, so don't take this as idiomatic Go code :-)
